# Vault

A private, PIN-locked photo and video vault built with React Native and Expo. Store your media securely in the app's sandboxed directory, organized into folders — completely hidden from your device gallery.

## Features

- **PIN protection** — 6-digit PIN stored in iOS Keychain / Android Keystore via `expo-secure-store`. Auto-locks when the app backgrounds.
- **Folders** — Create, rename, delete, and set cover photos for your media folders.
- **Import media** — Pick photos and videos from your gallery; files are copied into the app's private directory and removed from the picker view.
- **Media viewer** — Swipe horizontally through media, with a back button and swipe-down-to-close gesture.
- **Video playback** — Native video player with play/pause, a draggable seek bar, and current/total time display.
- **Video thumbnails** — Auto-generated thumbnails with duration badge in the folder grid.
- **Rotation** — Rotate photos and videos 90° at a time without cropping.
- **Slideshow** — Auto-advance slideshow with configurable slide duration (2s / 3s / 4s / 5s / 10s).
- **Sort & Filter** — Sort by date or name; filter by media type (photos/videos) or search by name.
- **Unhide** — Save any vaulted item back to your device gallery.
- **Move** — Move media items between folders.
- **Share** — Share any photo or video directly from the viewer.
- **Storage stats** — See folder count, total items, and space used in Settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- EAS CLI (`npm install -g eas-cli`) — for production builds
- Physical device recommended (simulator has no real media library)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debaditya5/vault-app.git
cd vault-app
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your device.

> **Note:** Some features (file system access, secure store, media library) require a physical device or a development build. They will not work correctly in Expo Go on a simulator.

## CI/CD — Tag-based Builds

Builds are **not triggered on every commit**. The pipeline runs only when:

1. **A version tag is pushed** — format `v*` (e.g. `v1.0.0`, `v1.2.3`)
2. **Manually dispatched** via the GitHub Actions UI (choose `preview` or `production` profile)

### Releasing a new build

```bash
# Commit and push your changes normally — no build is triggered
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my new feature"
git push

# When ready to distribute, create and push a version tag
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0   # ← this triggers the build
```

### Pipeline steps

1. Checkout + `npm ci`
2. EAS local build → `TimeMatrix.apk` (Android `preview` profile by default)
3. Upload to **Firebase App Distribution** with release notes showing the tag + commit SHA

### Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `EXPO_TOKEN` | Expo account token (account settings on expo.dev) |
| `FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase app ID from the Firebase console |
| `FIREBASE_TOKEN` | Firebase CI token (`firebase login:ci`) |

### EAS Build Profiles (`eas.json`)

| Profile | Output | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `development` | Internal distribution (dev client) | Local dev with Expo Dev Client |
| `preview` | APK, internal distribution | Testers via Firebase App Distribution |
| `production` | AAB, auto-increment version | Play Store submission |

## Security Notes

- The PIN is never stored in AsyncStorage — only in the OS secure enclave (`expo-secure-store`).
- All media files are stored in the app's `documentDirectory`, which is sandboxed and inaccessible to other apps.
- The vault auto-locks whenever the app moves to the background.
